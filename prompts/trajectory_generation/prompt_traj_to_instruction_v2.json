You will generate a diverse set of human-centric navigation instructions (which INSTRUCTION TYPE is 'High-Level-Diliver') based on a symbolic TEXT MAP, STARTING POINT, and END POINT.\r\n\r\nYou need to generate at least 2-4 instructions for each of the seven INSTRUCTION TYPES defined below, ensuring variety and diversity.\r\n\r\n\r\n<Input>\r\n1. TEXT MAP: A textual description of an environment, including named areas, objects, and their unique IDs (e.g., Bar counter_0, chair_5). This map is the single source of truth.\r\n    case:\r\n\"text_map\": \r\n{\r\n    \"Overview\": \"A dining hall with a Bar and Lounge Area.\",\r\n    \"Area 1: Bar Counter Area\": \"A bar counter(Bar counter_0) with several high chairs(high chair_0, high chair_1, high chair_2). Behind the counter, there is a trash can(trash_can_1).\",\r\n    \"Area 2: Dining Area\": \"Contains numerous tables(table_0 through table_10) and chairs(chair_0 through chair_27). A chandelier(chandelier_2) hangs above. table_6 is the only table with a vase on it. table_5 is empty.\",\r\n    \"Area 3: Lounge Area\": \"Features a multi-person sofa(Multi person sofa_1).\",\r\n    \"Area 4: Kitchen and Storage Area\": \"Contains a refrigerator(refrigerator_0) and a microwave oven(microwave oven_0).\",\r\n    \"Area 5: Windowed Seating Section\": \"This section, near the windows(window_2, window_3, window_4), offers seating. chair_20 is right by window_3, which is the closest window to it.\"\r\n}\r\n\r\n2. STARTING POINT: The starting point of the trajectory where instructions need to be constructed, represented by Object ID, such as chair_5.\r\n    case:\r\n\"starting_point\": \"chair_5\"\r\n\r\n3. END POINT: The endpoint of the trajectory for which instructions need to be constructed, represented by an Object ID, such as sofa_0.\r\n    case:\r\n\"end_point\": \"sofa_0\"\r\n<\/Input>\r\n\r\n\r\n<Task>\r\nYour task is to generate multiple natural language instructions for a trajectory with a STARTING POINT and an END POINT (obtained using the A* algorithm, representing an optimal short path). The TEXT MAP is used to assist your understanding of the entire map.\r\n\r\nYou need to generate at least 2-4 instructions for each of the INSTRUCTION TYPES defined below, ensuring variety and diversity.\r\n<\/Task>\r\n\r\n\r\n<Principles>\r\n1. Don't Embellish or Exaggerate: Since the trajectory with a STARTING POINT as the starting point and an END POINT as the end point is an optimal short path obtained by the A* algorithm, you are unaware of the points it passes through and the directions it turns. Therefore, you should NOT arbitrarily add content that is not within the scope of the known input information. For example, if the starting point is chair_5 and the end point is sofa_0, this trajectory may not pass through desk_2. Therefore, you cannot generate instructions such as \"Depart from the chair, pass through the desk, and arrive at the sofa\", nor can you generate uncertain instructions such as \"turn left, turn right\".\r\n\r\n2. NEVER Use Internal IDs: The instructions you generate must not contain the internal object IDs (e.g., chair_5). Your output must be natural language that a person without the map could understand.\r\n\r\n3. Stay Grounded in the Map: Do not invent objects, properties, or relationships that are not described or reasonably inferable from the text map. The robot must be able to solve the task using only the provided map information.\r\n\r\n4. Be Natural and Concise: Instructions should sound like a real person talking. Avoid robotic or overly formal language. Be direct and clear. Keep instructions between 5-20 words.\r\n\r\n5. Be Creative and Diverse: For each type, think of different ways to phrase the command. Vary sentence structure, vocabulary, and perspective. A small change in wording can create a valuable new data point.\r\n\r\n6. Avoid Repetition: Within each type, ensure instructions are meaningfully different, not just minor word variations.\r\n\r\n8. Ensure Executability: Every instruction must be actionable based solely on the provided map information.\r\n\r\n9. Strictly Adhere to Types: Each generated instruction must clearly fit the definition of its assigned type.\r\n<\/Principles>\r\n\r\n\r\n<Instruction_Types>\r\n1. Add_Causality\r\nDescription:\r\n    This instruction supplements reasonable causality between the starting point and the destination, such as adding specific related items, making the trajectory \"from A to B\" reasonable. For example, \"from the sofa to the bookshelf\" is changed to \"move the books on the sofa to the bookshelf\", where \"books\" is the added item, making such a trajectory conform to human daily life.\r\nExamples:\r\n    \"Please move the book from the coffee table to the bookshelf in the study.\"\r\n    \"Please move the teacup from the coffee table to the bookshelf in the study.\"\r\n2. Scenario_Driven\r\nDescription:\r\n    This instruction presents a specific scenario, which revolves around human purposes or goals, making the destination a reasonable place to carry out the action.\r\nExample:\r\n    \"I'm thirsty, please bring me a drink from the fridge.\"\r\n3. Relative_Relationship\r\nDescription:\r\n    The instruction uses relative spatial terms (e.g., \"next to,\" \"behind,\" \"the one on the left,\" \"across from,\" \"in front of\") to define the target, which is especially useful for nearby, similar objects.\r\nExample:\r\n    \"Move to the chair next to that table.\"\r\n4. Attribute-based\r\nDescription:\r\n    The instruction describes the target with specific, perceivable properties, requiring the robot to identify the object that uniquely matches the description. These properties can include color, state (on\/off, open\/closed), contents (empty\/full), size, or decoration.\r\nExample:\r\n    \"Find an empty table in the dining hall.\"\r\n5. Area-based\r\nDescription:\r\n    The instruction directs the robot to a general functional area (e.g., \"the kitchen,\" \"the lounge area\") rather than a specific object.\r\nExample:\r\n    \"Walk from here to the kitchen area.\"\r\n<\/Instruction_Types>\r\n\r\n\r\n<Output_Format>\r\nFor each instruction type, generate 2-4 diverse instructions. Your output should be a JSON array with the following structure:\r\n[\r\n  {\r\n    \"instruction_type\": \"Add_Causality\",\r\n  \"start\": \"[provided_starting_object_id]\",\r\n    \"end\": \"[provided_end_object_id]\",\n    \"generated_instruction\": \"[instruction_text]\"\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    \"instruction_type\": \"Area-based\",\r\n    \"trajectory_id\": \"[provided_id]\",\r\n    \"start\": \"[provided_starting_object_id]\",\r\n    \"end\": \"[provided_end_object_id]\",\n    \"generated_instruction\": \"[instruction_text]\"\r\n  },\r\n]\r\n<\/Output_Format>"
