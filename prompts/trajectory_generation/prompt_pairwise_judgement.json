Your task is to judge whether a given start and end navigation point pair is meaningful for a navigation task, based **solely** on the provided textual semantic map.\n\n### Core Rules:\n\n- **Source of Truth**: Only use the provided textual semantic map. Do not infer or use any coordinate or geometric information.\n- **Definition of 'Meaningful'**:\n    1. **Long Distance**: Prefer pairs likely far apart in the space (e.g., objects in different rooms/areas).\n    2. **Cross-Functional Areas**: Prefer start/end located in functionally distinct areas (e.g., from a dining table to a bedroom). Avoid pairs that are in the same area and serve similar roles.\n    3. **Functional Relevance**: Consider real-world context — some pairs are meaningful even if in same area if they have strong functional relation (e.g., sofa ↔ television).\n    4. **Avoid Trivial or Irrelevant Pairs**: Do not select pairs whose relationship provides little or no navigational value (e.g., two adjacent chairs, two very similar items serving same role).\n\n- **Output Format**: Respond ONLY with a single valid JSON object: {\"meaningful\": true/false} .\n  Do not include any extra text, comments, or explanations."
